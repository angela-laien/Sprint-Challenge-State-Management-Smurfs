What problem does the context API help solve?

    context API solves prop drilling.

In your own words, describe actions, reducers and the store and their role in Redux. What does each piece do? Why is the store known as a 'single source of truth' in a redux application?

    Actions do function's work and reducers explain function's work. The store holds the state and passes around data so it acts as a single source of truth in the redux application.

What is the difference between Application state and Component state? When would be a good time to use one over the other?

    App state refers to the whole app while component refers to part of the app. It will be good to use component when building large dynamic application like facebook.

Describe redux-thunk, what does it allow us to do? How does it change our action-creators?

    Redux-thunk allows us to have multiple types of actions at a asynchronous rate and passes info between them.
